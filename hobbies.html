    <h2>Cross Country</h2>
    <p>
      I love to jog simply because it's such a simple thing to partake in. Going
      for jogs helps clear the mind and a lot of the times the destination is
      the last thing on your mind. I was a part of my high school's cross
      country and track team and although not necessarily the fastest, it was
      still a thrill to test my endurance in the field. I loved the encouraging
      atmoshpere the team brought and it always felt great to finish up a long
      session.

    <h2>Myster/Horror Podcasts</h2>
    <p>
      I am absolutely enamored with lisetening to tales of horror weather it be
      real life experiences, or encounters with supernatural enteties. Some of
      my favorite horror channels include Mr.Nightmare, Maverick Files, Nexpo, &
      Nick Crowley. I love to hear about disturbing cases regarding missing
      people, haunted properties and unsolved mysteries. I also grew up
      listening to CreepyPastas which is why my greatest fear is the fear of the
      unknown. Channels like CreepsMcPasta & Mr.Creepypasta would leave me
      shaking at night when I was all alone. Some notable creepypastas that have
      stuck with me until today would be: Penpal, Rap Rat, Russian Sleep
      Experiment, and Your Secret Admirer.

    <h2>Reading</h2>
    <p>
      I loved to read a lot as a child and I grew up with some famous series
      like Percy Jackson, Harry Potter, & The Chronicals of Narnia. The funny
      thing is that I haven't seen a single movie from all the franchises I've
      read. I remember taking these books everywhere because the stories and
      adventures in each one was so captivating. The struggles of Harry in
      discovering who he really is and what his destiny entails, to the
      progression and tragic curroption of the beautiful land of Narnia made my
      imagination run wild.
